# Introduction

Welcome to the practical application sessions of the **Mannheim Master in Management
Analytics - Accounting Class 2024.** In the next two days you will see how to solve common
business applications with R and Excel and to dive deeper into web-scraping. The goal of
those sessions is to give you a general overview of how common workflows can be
automated/streamlined.

All sessions are programmed in R and a basic understanding of programming is needed. The
code itself applies relatively advanced methods, but we will go through it step-by-step.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Install R and Rstudio

You will need R and RStudio installed for the interactive exercises. The process is
straight-forward and already has been well explained by others so please follow that link
to install the necessary components for R and Rstudio:

<https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html>

In case you have any problems (that always happens, no worries), we will solve this in
class.

# Get The Code

The complete code is hosted on my GitHub page: <https://github.com/MatthiasUckert/RpMMA24>

Simply fork the repository into your own GitHub or download the Project.

| Day            | Description                                       |
+:===============+:==================================================+
| Day 1          | **Building an Excel Business Case**               |
|                |                                                   |
|                | In this session we will start by building a       |
|                | simple business case in Excel. Specifically, we   |
|                | will evaluate a small business decision with      |
|                | common metrics such as Contribution Margins.      |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| Day 2          | **Getting Data from the Web**                     |
|                |                                                   |
|                | In this session we will learn how to scrape       |
|                | websites if no API is provided. Specifically we   |
|                | will download PDF Annual Reports from             |
|                | www.AnnualReport.com. Additionally, we will learn |
|                | how the use the Electronic Data Gathering,        |
|                | Analysis, and Retrieval system (EDGAR) API to     |
|                | download US Financial Reports.                    |
