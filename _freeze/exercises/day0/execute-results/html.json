The setup is intuitive. Kindly follow the [**instructions**](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) to install the necessary components.\n\n# Downloading the Public GitHub Repository\n\n1.  **Open the Repository in a Web Browser**:\n\n    -   Navigate to the provided URL: [**https://github.com/MatthiasUckert/RpMMA24-Code**](https://github.com/MatthiasUckert/RpMMA24-Code)\n\n2.  **Find the 'Code' Button**:\n\n    -   On the main page of the repository, you'll see a green button labeled \"Code\".\n\n3.  **Download as ZIP**:\n\n    -   Click on the \"Code\" button.\n\n    -   In the dropdown menu, you'll see an option to \"Download ZIP\". Click on this option.\n\n    -   This will start downloading the entire repository as a ZIP file to your computer.\n\n4.  **Extract the ZIP File**:\n\n    -   Once the download is complete, navigate to the location where the ZIP file was saved (typically the \"Downloads\" folder).\n\n    -   Right-click on the ZIP file (named **`RpMMA24-Code-main.zip`** or similar) and choose the option to \"Extract All\" (the exact wording might vary depending on your operating system).\n\n    -   Choose a destination folder for the extracted files and click \"Extract\".\n\n5.  **Open the R Project**:\n\n    -   Navigate to the extracted folder.\n\n    -   Inside, you should find a file with the **`.Rproj`** extension, which represents the R Project.\n\n    -   If you have RStudio installed, you can double-click on this **`.Rproj`** file to open the project in RStudio. If not, you can still navigate through the folder and open individual R scripts using any text editor or R itself.\n\n# Restoring the Project from the renv Lockfile\n\nIn this section, we will restore the project's R packages using the **`renv.lock`** file. This ensures that all students have the same package versions for consistency and reproducibility.\n\n1.  Make sure you have the **`renv`** package installed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"renv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.  Initialize the renv project with this command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrenv::init()\n```\n:::\n\n\n**You should see the following output:**\n\n*`This project already has a lockfile. What would you like to do?`*\n\n*`1: Restore the project from the lockfile.`*\n\n*`2: Discard the lockfile and re-initialize the project.`*\n\n*`3: Activate the project without snapshotting or installing any packages.`*\n\n*`4: Abort project initialization.`*\n\n*`Selection:`*\n\n**Type 1 and click enter**\n\nThis should now install all necessary dependencies onto you computer (depending on your internet connection and computer specs this process might take 5 minutes or more)\n",
